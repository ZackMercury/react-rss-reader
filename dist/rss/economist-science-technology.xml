Well-to-do Romans of the early Empire, for instance, would tour the place to look at antiquities older to them than the Colosseum is to a tourist today. Yet Egypt keeps secrets still. Its royal tombs, both those underground and the skyward-reaching pyramids, are rife with stories of hidden chambers. And, in the most famous tomb of all, the Great Pyramid of Giza, one such has just been shown to be real.</p><p>It was discovered by Kunihiro Morishima of Nagoya University, in Japan, and his colleagues. They searched not by the time-honoured archaeological techniques of digging with trowels and knocking down walls with hammers, but by muon tomography—an esoteric way of looking inside things using the fallout from cosmic rays that have hit Earth’s atmosphere. Muons are heavy kin to electrons. They are able to penetrate solid matter to some degree, but are eventually absorbed by it. By measuring the absorption rate of...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730864-muons-cosmic-rays-illuminated-it-new-chamber-has-been-detected-great?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

For drivers of electric cars, though, those stations are few and far between. The infrastructure needed for refilling batteries has yet to be developed, and the technology which that infrastructure will use is still up for grabs. Most electric cars are fitted with plugs. But plugs and their associated cables and charging points bring problems. The cables are trip hazards. The charging points add to street clutter. And the copper wire involved is an invitation to thieves. Many engineers would therefore like to develop a second way of charging electric vehicles—one that is wireless and can thus be buried underground.</p><p>Electrical induction, the underlying principle behind wireless charging, was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831, and is widely used in things such as electric motors and generators. Faraday observed that moving a conductor through a magnetic field induced a current in that conductor....<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730623-electromagnetic-induction-gets-rid-cables-it-now-practical-refuel?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

That is certainly the view of longline fishermen in southern Alaska. The good deed in question is the end of commercial whaling, courtesy of a moratorium agreed, in 1982, by the countries once involved in that trade. Most of the species that have benefited from the moratorium are baleen whales. These feed by filtering small organisms such as krill from the water, using hairy plates (made of tissue called baleen) as sieves. Some whales, though, have teeth, and hunt larger prey, such as fish and squid. The largest of these is the sperm whale, once a prize target for whalers because of the oil contained in an organ that it uses for echolocation.</p><p>How badly sperm whales were hit by whaling is hard to know, but their population is certainly recovering. America’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) estimates that, since the moratorium went into effect in 1986, their population has grown at about...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730627-unwilling-fishermen-provide-them-free-lunches-after-years-persecution?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

The complete instrument would also have had a rotating pointer, called an alidade, mounted on a pin running through the central hole. The plate itself is 17.5cm in diameter, but less than 2mm thick, and has recently been examined by scanning with a laser beam, by Mark Williams of the University of Warwick, in Britain. Dr Williams used the laser to create a high-resolution, three-dimensional “point cloud” of individual spots on the plate’s surface. This reveals detail invisible to conventional photography. The blue picture, showing the reverse side of the plate from the natural-light picture, is a result of such a scan.</p><p><em class="Italic">Esmeralda</em>, the vessel the astrolabe came from, was part of Vasco da Gama’s second expedition to India.

One line of these creatures gave rise to birds. But the rest, though they could not fly, nevertheless seem to have had patterns in their plumage, just as birds do. This can be seen from the distribution in their fossils of pigment particles called melanosomes.

And the Allen Institute for Brain Science, in Seattle, has found a way to recycle what is perhaps the most valuable waste of all—living human brain tissue. Understandably, few people are willing to donate parts of their brains to science while they are still alive. But, by collaborating with seven local neurosurgeons, the institute’s chief scientist, Christof Koch, and his colleagues, have managed to round up specimens of healthy tissue removed by those surgeons in order to get to unhealthy parts beyond them, which needed surgical ministration. Normally, such tissue would be disposed of as waste. Instead, Dr Koch is making good use of it.</p><p>The repository the cells from these samples end up in is a part of a wider project, the Allen Cell Types Database. The first data from the newly collected human brain cells were released on October 25th. The Allen database, which is open for anyone to search, thus now includes information...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730676-waste-not-want-not-first-data-repository-living-human-brain-cells?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

This tool, developed from a bacterial defence system that cuts up the DNA of invading viruses, permits genetic material to be edited easily and precisely. It has transformed research in biology, and promises to have wide applications in agriculture and medicine.</p><p>But it is not ideal. One of its flaws is that its ability to replace genes works best in cells that are replicating, and thus have the correct molecular furniture in place to incorporate the new DNA being delivered. A second is that it starts by breaking the DNA strands so that new material can be inserted into the gap. That can have undesirable effects. A third is that it is not particularly good at correcting point mutations. These are errors which affect only one or two of the bases, known informally as genetic “letters”, in a gene’s DNA sequence. This flaw is especially problematic because tens of thousands...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730615-it-can-now-edit-individual-genetic-letters-gene-editing-takes-another-step-forward?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[<p><div class=""></div></p><p>IN 2016 Lee Sedol, one of the world’s best players of Go, lost a match in Seoul to a computer program called AlphaGo by four games to one. It was a big event, both in the history of Go and in the history of artificial intelligence (AI). Go occupies roughly the same place in the culture of China, Korea and Japan as chess does in the West. After its victory over Mr Lee, AlphaGo beat dozens of renowned human players in a series of anonymous games played online, before re-emerging in May to face Ke Jie, the game’s best player, in Wuzhen, China. Mr Ke fared no better than Mr Lee, losing to the computer 3-0.</p><p>For AI researchers, Go is equally exalted. Chess fell to the machines in 1997, when Garry Kasparov lost a match to Deep Blue, an IBM computer. But until Mr Lee’s defeat, Go’s complexity had made it resistant to the march of machinery. AlphaGo’s victory was an eye-catching demonstration of the power of a type of AI called machine learning, which aims to get computers to teach complicated tasks to themselves.</p><p></p><p>AlphaGo learned to play Go by studying thousands of games between expert human opponents, extracting rules and strategies from those games and then refining them in millions more matches which the program played against itself. That was enough to make it stronger than any human player.

Less than two weeks after Sweden’s Royal Academy of Science announced that it was awarding this year’s Nobel physics prize “for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves”, that detector has come up with its most interesting finding yet.</p><p>LIGO is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. Actually, it is two observatories, 3,002km apart in the American states of Louisiana and Washington—a degree of separation ensuring that only disturbances registered by both are considered as coming from outer space. Its purpose, as its name suggests, is to detect gravitational waves. These are ripples in space, propagated at the speed of light, that are created by tumultuous astronomical events involving gargantuan bodies. Their existence was predicted, just over a century ago, by the mathematics of Albert Einstein’s general theory...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730326-stellar-collision-glows-bright-and-shakes-fabric-space-gravitational-wave?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

A warmer climate will increase sea-surface temperatures relative to those of the adjacent atmosphere in some regions, leading to more evaporation, more clouds and stronger storms. You might expect this to be reflected in the geological record. But a study just published in <em class="Italic">Geology</em> by Michael Toomey of the United States Geological Survey suggests, counter-intuitively, that the hurricanes which struck Florida during a cool period 12,000 years ago were more powerful than those during a subsequent time of warmth.</p><p>Dr Toomey’s findings stem from his analysis of sediment cores collected near the Dry Tortugas, islands off Florida’s coast. These contain strata laid down during the Younger Dryas, a time when the climate cooled, and also during the warmer years that followed it.

It also has important practical uses. One such is in Semantic Scholar, a system developed by researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, in Seattle, for the purpose of ferreting out the scientific papers most relevant to a particular problem. This week Marie Hagman, the project’s leader, and her colleagues have launched an updated version of the system. They have added 26m biomedical-research papers to the 12m previously contained in its database, and upgraded the way that the database’s contents can be searched and correlated. Instead of relying on citations in other papers, or the frequency of recurring phrases to rank the relevance of papers, as it once did and rivals such as Google Scholar still do, the new version of Semantic Scholar applies AI to try to understand the context of those phrases, and thus achieve better results.</p><p>Like most AI systems, the new Semantic Scholar relies on a...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730489-get-neural-network-do-it-you-better-way-search-through-scientific?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>

It takes a lot of rain to create those forty shades of green. But it is not the kind of place you would expect to be affected by a hurricane. That, though, is what is happening today, as former Hurricane Ophelia batters the island, causing all schools to close and, so far, killing three people. Over the next 24 hours it is expected to hit parts of Scotland as well.</p><p>Like many Atlantic storms, Ophelia formed south-west of the Azores, where areas of low pressure often occur. Most such systems, though, are blown west towards the Caribbean. Ophelia barely moved for a week after its formation, and was then blown north. This is unusual, though not unprecedented. The remnants of Hurricane Gordon affected Ireland and Britain in 2006, disrupting play at the Ryder Cup golf tournament.</p><p></p><p>Hurricanes draw their strength from warm water. The seas in the Atlantic have been 0.5°-1°C warmer than usual this year, according to Britain’s...<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730329-unusual-storm-eastern-atlantic-ophelias-strange-path?fsrc=rss">Continue reading</a>]]></description>
